## Tech stack explained
This is a react app created with vite.

Dependencies:
- redux toolkit query for fetching and caching data
- react-boostrap for UI design

## General walk through
I created 3 components in order to make the code as reusable as possible.
- ProgressBar: to display the progress bar seen at the top
- SelectSkip: which is the main page that houses both the progress bar and the skips.
- SkipCard: to abstract the individual skip and their functionalities
